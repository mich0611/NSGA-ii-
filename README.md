# NSGA-ii
Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, one of the evolutionary computation algorithm is getting more attention recently.
Because many real-word optimization problems are not single objective. Sometimes we need to consider trade-off between objectives dimension
higher than one. Finding the best solutions among it becomes quite tough and arduous. 
The above code shows the basic implementation of NSGA ii, and apply it to three benchmark problems. (SRN, TC2, CONSTR). 
The future of my interested research would be the auto-stopping criterion of NSGA ii, and I'm Still working on it.
>< Hope you guys like it.
